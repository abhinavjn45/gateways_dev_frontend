/**
 * Public entry point for the 3D village.
 *
 * Three responsibilities, all of them about NOT breaking the site:
 *
 * 1. **ssr: false.** Three.js touches `window` and WebGL at import time; server
 *    rendering it throws. The whole bundle is also ~600kB, so keeping it out of
 *    the initial payload matters for every page that is not the world.
 *
 * 2. **Capability detection.** WebGL is missing or blocklisted on older
 *    hardware, in some VMs, and when a user has disabled it. We check for a real
 *    context before mounting, and hand back a `supported: false` signal so the
 *    caller can show the 2D map instead of a black rectangle.
 *
 * 3. **Reduced motion.** A camera the user cannot stop moving is exactly what
 *    motion-sensitive users need protection from, so we offer the 2D view
 *    rather than autoplaying a 3D scene at them.
