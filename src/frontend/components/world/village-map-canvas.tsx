/**
 * The village, drawn once into a canvas.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT redrawn on pan or zoom: the parent viewport CSS-transforms
 * this element, so the browser scales the already-rasterised bitmap on the
 * compositor. Re-rendering ~12k cubes per frame to get sharper edges would
 * trade a smooth 60fps drag for a slideshow.
 *
 * The draw is deferred one frame past mount. It is a few hundred milliseconds
 * of synchronous canvas work, and running it during the commit would hold up
 * first paint on the whole route — this way the layout, labels and controls are
 * on screen first and the terrain fades in under them.
