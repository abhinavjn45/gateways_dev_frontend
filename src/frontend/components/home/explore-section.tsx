/**
 * The events + schedule gateway.
 *
 * The teaser is the fest's REAL event categories, read through `repo` — it used
 * to be three hardcoded cards ("BUILD.EXE", "NODE CONTROL", "PIXEL GRID") that
 * were branding from the theme deck and matched no seeded event, so tapping one
 * opened a modal that never mentioned the name the visitor had just clicked.
 * Categories are the actual domains a participant enters, they carry their own
 * one-line description, and they stay correct when the event list changes.
 *
 * The full lists still open in modals rather than unrolling inline — that keeps
 * the registration CTA within reach of the fold instead of pushing it past a
 * thirteen-row event table.
 */

/**
 * Category slug → hotbar item.
 *
 * Keyed by slug rather than id: slugs are the stable, human-readable handle in
 * the seed, and a category that arrives from a future backend with a new id
 * still lands on its icon. Anything unmapped falls back to the chest.
