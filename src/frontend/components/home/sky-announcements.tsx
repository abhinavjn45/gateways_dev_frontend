/**
 * Announcements written inside drifting pixel clouds.
 *
 * This replaces the ticker bar that used to sit under the nav. A marquee is a
 * strip of chrome bolted across the page; here each fact rides in its own cloud
 * among the panorama's, so the announcement is part of the world rather than an
 * overlay on top of it.
 *
 * The cloud is built from blocks rather than a background image: a lit top
 * face, a body, a shaded underside, plus a few bumps above and nubs below to
 * break the rectangle into a stepped silhouette. Every offset is a multiple of
 * `--mc-unit`, so the whole shape rescales with `--mc-scale` and its edges stay
 * on the pixel grid at 2×, 3× and 4×.
 *
 * CSS animation, not GSAP and not Framer: each cloud is one looping transform
 * on one element with no coordination between them — the case the animation
 * ruleset assigns to CSS. Variation comes from a per-cloud duration and a
 * NEGATIVE delay, which starts each one partway through its cycle so they never
 * drift in lockstep. (A positive delay would instead leave them all frozen at
 * the origin for the first few seconds.)
 *
 * Reduced motion needs no branch here. The keyframe returns to its origin, so
 * the global `animation-duration: 0.01ms` override lands each cloud exactly
 * where it already is.
 */

/**
 * The clouds are laid out as an ARCH over the wordmark.
 *
 * Read left to right the tops go 20% → 6% → 6% → 20%: the two outer clouds hang
 * low at the edges, the two inner ones ride high over the centre, so the four
 * of them describe a shallow vault with PARALLAX sitting under its keystone.
 *
 * Two constraints hold it together, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. The inner pair sits ABOVE the title, not beside it — they are the highest
 *    things in the sky precisely because they are the ones over the centre.
 * 2. Every cloud is pinned to an edge and width-capped, so none can reach the
 *    centre column horizontally. Vertical clearance alone is not enough: the
 *    hero centres its content, so on a short viewport the title climbs, and a
 *    cloud that merely sits above it at 1440×900 would collide at 1280×720.
 *    The width cap makes that impossible rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * Order matters — index 2 and 3 are the inner (high) pair and are the first to
 * be dropped, because an arch that cannot fit is better shown as two low clouds
 * than as four overlapping ones.
 *
 * VISIBILITY IS GATED ON VIEWPORT HEIGHT, not only width, and that is the
 * subtle part. These tops are percentages of the hero, but the hero centres its
 * content vertically — so as the viewport gets shorter the title block occupies
 * proportionally more of it and climbs into the arch. Below roughly 700px the
 * hero content no longer fits at all and overflows upward, putting the wordmark
 * near the top of the screen: measured at 1024×600, the inner pair overlapped
 * the glyphs by 84px, where the same layout has 150px of clearance at 1440×900.
 * Width alone cannot express that — a short window is short however wide it is.
 *
 * The thresholds are viewport heights, not screen heights. A 900px-tall laptop
 * gives roughly 800px of viewport once browser chrome is subtracted, so gating
 * the arch at 820px would have hidden it on the most common laptop there is.
