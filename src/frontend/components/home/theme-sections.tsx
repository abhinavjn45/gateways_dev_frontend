            This was a fixed black wash with white text, on the rule that the
            caption sits on scene art whose backdrop never changes — so themed
            tokens would have darkened it against a constant. That rule was
            right for as long as it held. It stopped holding the moment the card
            gained `lightScene`: the backdrop is now a night workshop OR a day
            one, and a hard black slab that disappeared into the first reads as a
            hole punched in the second.

            So it goes back to the semantic layer, which is what that layer is
            for — `panel` and `text` flip together, and `info` is the one accent
            that already has a light-theme value solved for cream (a deep teal,
            where dark uses diamond). What must never come back is the ORIGINAL
            bug: `bg-mc-slot/95` with a hardcoded `text-white`, one token themed
            and the other not, which is how white on sand happened. Both sides of
            a contrast pair are themed here, or neither is. */}

 * It goes to `/portal` — the gate — rather than straight to `/entering`.
 * `/entering` is a transition that immediately redirects, so jumping there from
