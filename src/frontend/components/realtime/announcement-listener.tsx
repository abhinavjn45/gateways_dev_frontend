 * Turns new announcements into toasts (mockup SCREEN 9).
 *
 * Mounted ONCE in the authed layout, so there is exactly one subscription for
 * the whole session regardless of navigation. That single-subscription discipline
 * matters more after the MySQL migration, where a per-component subscription
 * would start a poll per mount — but establishing it now means the consumer
 * does not change when the backend does.
 *
 * `repo.announcements.subscribe` already has the signature the server-backed
 * poll will have, and locally it fires across tabs via the storage event.
