/**
 * A clickable world-map location marker.
 *
 * Rendered as a real `<Link>`, so it is keyboard-focusable, opens in a new tab
 * on middle-click, and is crawlable — a div with onClick would lose all three.
 * `onSelect` runs alongside navigation for the map's own selection state; it
 * does not replace the href.
 *
 * Positioned by percentage so it tracks the map through pan and zoom without
 * the viewport having to do per-child maths.
 *
 * The chip **counter-scales** with the map. Without that, zooming to 2.5×
 * inflates the label to the size of a building and the map disappears behind
 * its own furniture; labels are UI, and UI should hold its size while the
 * terrain under it grows.
