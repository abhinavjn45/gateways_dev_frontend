/**
 * The crest assembles itself out of flying blocks, then reveals the site.
 *
 * Inspired by the Ra.One (2011) Q-BRICKS cube-assembly sequence — cubes converge
 * out of the dark and resolve into a solid form — rebuilt in the project's voxel
 * idiom and, unlike the original's 8-10 hours per frame, running at 60fps.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSEMBLES INTO: not the original artwork. `scripts/gen-splash-mask.mjs`
 * redraws the crest as real pixel art — 152x152, snapped to the gold token ramp —
 * and that is what the blocks build. Landing on the smooth 1254px original would
 * undo the whole effect: the pixels would resolve into something that was never
 * made of pixels.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS: the pixel crest is sliced into a 38x38 grid via CSS
 * background-position, one <span> per cell, each carrying a 4x4 chunk of art.
 * Only the 639 cells that actually contain artwork are rendered — the mask is
 * generated alongside the art, so no image decode or canvas read gates the
 * animation. Each block flies in from a randomised radial offset wearing a solid
 * gold cube face; the face fades on landing to reveal that block's chunk of the
 * crest. That two-layer trick is what makes it read as blocks ASSEMBLING rather
 * than an image wiping in.
 *
 * Rendering all 5233 art pixels as their own animated nodes would have been the
 * literal reading of "build it out of pixels", but it puts ~750KB of markup in
 * every page's HTML; flying 4x4 chunks looks the same and costs a twelfth of that.
 *
 * WHAT IT STANDS IN FRONT OF: the hero's own landscape, thrown far out of focus,
 * rather than a flat fill. The splash then reads as being staged in the world the
 * site opens onto, and the final zoom becomes a focus pull into it instead of a
 * cut between two unrelated surfaces. It is the same `overworld-panorama` scene
 * data the hero uses — not a copy of it — so retuning the hero retunes this.
 *
 * IT IS AN OVERLAY, NOT A GATE. The app renders and hydrates underneath, so the
 * homepage's LCP is untouched — the splash only covers it. Everything below is
 * about making sure that cover always lifts:
 *
 *   - a hard timeout force-dismisses it even if the timeline never completes
 *   - any pointer or key press skips it
 *   - reduced motion (OS or the in-app toggle) skips it before it ever builds
 *   - it plays at most once per tab, and a boot script in the root layout hides
 *     it before first paint on repeat loads so there is no flash
 *   - <noscript> CSS in globals.css hides it when JS never runs
 */

/**
 * Ceiling on how long the overlay may cover the app, whatever the timeline does.
 * Must stay comfortably above the timeline's own ~5.6s, or it would cut the
 * animation off rather than act as a backstop.
