 * LAYERED SCENE MANIFEST — backgrounds, portal scenes, biome illustrations.
 *
 * A scene is an ordered stack of full-bleed layers, each with a parallax
 * `depth`. Depth 0 is infinitely far (never moves); 1 moves with the pointer at
 * full rate. Splitting a background into sky/far/mid/fore is what makes parallax
 * possible at all — a single flat image cannot have depth.
 *
 * All art is ORIGINAL voxel-inspired work. Nothing here references or reuses
 * Mojang assets: the briefs describe generic blocky landscapes, and the naming
 * avoids their terminology entirely. See ART-ASSETS.md for the per-layer prompt
 * guidance for AI generation or hand illustration.
 *
 * Every layer renders a distinguishable generated placeholder until the real
 * file exists, so parallax is visible and tunable before any art is delivered.
