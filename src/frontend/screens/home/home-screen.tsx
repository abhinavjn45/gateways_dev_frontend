/**
 * SCREEN 0 — the homepage.
 *
 * The front door reads as one continuous descent: the panning overworld hero,
 * then what the fest is, then what the theme means, then what is on, then how
 * to take part. The portal CTA sits below the theme sections rather than up
 * here — it is the one irreversible action on the page, and everything above it
 * is what helps someone decide to press it.
 *
 * The two modals are owned here rather than inside their trigger components,
 * because both the nav and the Explore section open the same two dialogs. One
 * owner means one open dialog, and no chance of two copies of the events list
 * mounting at once.
 *
 * Announcements are not a bar under the nav — they drift in the hero's sky
 * (see `sky-announcements.tsx`), so the page opens on the world rather than on
 * a strip of chrome.
