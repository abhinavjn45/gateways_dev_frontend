/**
 * Runs before hydration, so a repeat load in the same tab never shows a frame of
 * the splash. The overlay is in the server HTML on purpose — that is what stops
 * the homepage flashing before hydration on a first visit — which means the
 * "already seen" decision has to be made before first paint, and only an inline
 * blocking script can do that. Same shape as the usual theme-flash fix.
 *
 * IT INJECTS A <style> RATHER THAN SETTING AN ATTRIBUTE ON <html>. The obvious
 * version stamps `data-splash-seen` on the root element, but React renders <html>
 * here, so hydration finds an attribute that was not in the server output and
 * warns ("some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match"). The usual
 * answer is `suppressHydrationWarning` on <html>, which silences the symptom and
 * every future mismatch on that element with it. Appending a style element keeps
 * the script entirely outside React's tree, so there is nothing to reconcile.
 *
 * Worst case (the style is somehow dropped) is a brief flash of the overlay
 * before the component unmounts itself — never a stuck overlay.
 *
 * The key is inlined rather than imported because this executes before any
 * module has loaded; `SPLASH_SEEN_KEY` is interpolated in so the two cannot drift.

/**
 * Paints the correct colour theme before first paint. Without it a visitor who
 * chose light gets a full frame of the dark page first — the classic theme
 * flash, and a nasty one here because the page is near-black.
 *
 * It STAMPS AN ATTRIBUTE, unlike SPLASH_BOOT above, and that difference is
 * deliberate rather than an inconsistency. The splash decision collapses to one
 * `display:none` rule, so a script-injected <style> expresses it completely and
 * keeps the script outside React's tree. A theme cannot be expressed that way:
 * globals.css keys a whole token table off `html[data-theme="light"]`, and the
 * only alternatives are to duplicate that table into a JS string (two sources of
 * truth for every colour in the app) or to duplicate it again inside a
 * `prefers-color-scheme` block so the attribute is only needed for overrides.
 * Both are worse than the cost below.
 *
 * That cost is `suppressHydrationWarning` on <html>: React renders that element,
 * so an attribute the server did not emit is a mismatch. The flag applies to one
 * element's own attributes and direct text content — it does NOT propagate to
 * descendants, so this does not blind us to mismatches anywhere else in the tree.
 *
 * The attribute is always set, including when following the OS, so there is
 * exactly one theme block in CSS. `applyThemeAttribute()` recomputes the same
 * value from the same key after hydration.
