/**
 * The portal gate.
 *
 * The homepage's "Start the Journey" lands here, and this is where the realm
 * actually begins: "Enter the Portal" fires the wipe into `/entering`, which
 * branches to login or straight through to the world.
 *
 * It lives in the `(portal)` route group so it inherits that layout's
 * `PortalTransitionProvider` — which is what makes the transition work in BOTH
 * directions. The provider's overlay covers before navigating away, and
 * consumes a pending transition on arrival, so the homepage's wipe fades out
 * over this page instead of cutting to it.
 *
 * Kept as its own route rather than folded into the homepage hero: the gate is
 * a full-viewport cinematic with its own entry choreography, and a visitor who
 * has decided to go in should not have to scroll past the fest pitch again.
