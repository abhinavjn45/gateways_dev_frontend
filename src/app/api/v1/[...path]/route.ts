 * WHY A PROXY AND NOT DIRECT CALLS. The backend issues its session as
 * `__session` with `sameSite: 'lax'`. Browsers do not attach a Lax cookie to a
 * cross-site `fetch`, so a browser on the frontend origin calling the backend
 * origin directly would never send it — authentication cannot work that way, and
 * no amount of CORS configuration changes it.
 *
 * Routing every call through here means the browser only ever talks to ONE
 * origin. `__session` and `csrf_token` come back through this handler and are
 * set on the frontend origin, which makes them first-party. Three things follow:
 * Lax keeps working, CORS never applies (a server-to-server request sends no
 * `Origin`), and third-party-cookie blocking in Safari/Chrome is irrelevant.
 * The backend needs no changes at all.
 *
 * The cost is one extra hop, and the frontend server must be able to reach the
 * backend — this is a server-side URL, deliberately not `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
